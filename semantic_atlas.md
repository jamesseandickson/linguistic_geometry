# 🗺️ Semantic Geometry Atlas  
  
This file contains a description of various geometries, and lists candidate concepts that may potentially be better encoded at lower entropy states by non-tensor geometries, compared to the current LLM gold-standard.
  
## 1️⃣ Basic Euclidean geometries  
  
*Meaning as points, arrows, and simple directions — the calm, flat landscape of linguistic space.*

| 🔹 Scalars $\mathbb{R}$ | Single number. No direction, just "how much". | Elements of a field (typically $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{C}$). Invariant under rotation; represent magnitude or intensity without orientation. | A thermometer: 12°C, no arrow—only size. | May suit 1-dimensional semantic intensity.<br><br>• Sentiment intensity: "good → excellent", "bad → terrible" (valence magnitude).<br>• Certainty: "maybe → definitely" (confidence scalar).<br>• Formality: "informal → formal" (if context fixed). |
| 🧭 Vectors $v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ | An arrow: magnitude + direction. A point in multi-dimensional semantic space. | Elements of a vector space $V$. Transform under $GL(n)$. Inner product gives lengths, angles, and similarity. | A location + direction in meaning space: "where is this word?". | Could work for multi-dimensional static meanings.<br><br>• Embeddings of "happy", "sad", "angry".<br>• "Polite" vs "rude" in a politeness–stance–formality subspace.<br>• "Doctor", "lawyer", "teacher" in a profession manifold. |
  
  
## 2️⃣ Linear maps & rotations  
  
*Where meaning begins to move, transform, and show structure.*

| 🔄 Linear transforms $A : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ | A machine that stretches, shrinks, flips, or rotates vectors in a straight, predictable way. | Any map representable as matrix multiplication. Preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. Fundamental for modelling semantic operations as linear operators. | A meaning dial: turn the knob and the meaning moves predictably. | May suit consistent, regular semantic shifts.<br><br>• Tense: "walk → walked" (simple linear morpho-shift).<br>• Comparative: "big → bigger".<br>• Negation prefix: "happy → unhappy". |
| 🔁 Rotations $R \in SO(n)$ | A rigid turning of space—changing direction, not size. | Orthogonal matrices with $\det R = +1$. Preserve norms and inner products. Symmetry group of Euclidean space. | A semantic compass, rotating meanings around a conceptual origin. | Could model opposites or axes.<br><br>• "North ↔ south", "up ↔ down" (spatial axes).<br>• "Before ↔ after" (temporal axis).<br>• "Increase ↔ decrease" (causal axis). |
  
  
## 3️⃣ Spinors & SU(2)  
  
*Where meaning "twists", not just moves — hidden structure, double covers, and semantic rotations with memory.*

| 🌀 Spinors (elements of $\mathbb{C}^2$ or $\mathbb{C}^n$ with 720° identity) | A special kind of "rotation vector" that needs two full turns (720°) to get back to itself. Carries orientation in a richer way. | Representations of the group $Spin(3) \cong SU(2)$. Encode orientation with phase information. Transform under the double cover of rotations: $R \in SO(3) \mapsto U \in SU(2)$. | A semantic Möbius strip: twist meaning halfway, it flips; twist again, it returns. | Potentially useful for binary flips, opposites, symmetrical conceptual pairs.<br>• polarity: polite ↔ rude, happy ↔ sad, kind ↔ cruel.<br>• spatial axes: left ↔ right, in ↔ out.<br>• negation: legal ↔ illegal (prefix or lexical). |
| ⚛️ SU(2) rotations (unitary 2×2 matrices with $\det=1$) | The mathematical machinery that rotates spinors smoothly. | Continuous Lie group capturing all 3D rotations via unitary transformations. A richer, phase-carrying rotational algebra. | A 3-axis joystick for meaning, rotating concepts smoothly in ways vectors cannot. | May be useful for multi-axis conceptual flips when there are two or three interacting oppositions.<br>• social stance: supportive ↔ hostile (warm/cold + open/closed).<br>• formality: casual → formal (but with politeness and authority axes intertwined).<br>• evidentiality: visible → inferred → reported → assumed (cyclical epistemic phases). |
| 🧬 Spin-n representations | Like spin-½ but more elaborate (spin-1, spin-3/2…). | Higher irreps of $SU(2)$, dimension $2j+1$. Encode more complex phase/orientation states. | A multi-petalled semantic flower: more lobes = more nuanced orientations. | Potentially applicable when a concept has multi-phase or cyclic states.<br>• temporal aspect: start → ongoing → finish (spin-1 could be a fit).<br>• emotion cycles: calm → anxious → panicked → calm (quasi-cyclic).<br>• power dynamics: submissive → equal → dominant (3-state). |
  
  
## 4️⃣ Non-Euclidean geometries  
  
***When meaning lives on curved worlds — distances bend, parallels misbehave, and concepts travel along warped paths.***  
  
These geometries may be relevant when linguistic structure **is not linear**, **not symmetric**, or **not globally consistent** — where "going from A → B" depends on where you start, and concepts curve around each other.

| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🏔️ Positive curvature (spherical / $S^n$) | Like living on a globe: travel straight and you eventually return. Opposites meet. | Riemannian manifold with $K>0$. Geodesics converge. Global symmetry but no global linearity. | A semantic Earth: "north" eventually meets "south" if you keep going. | Could suit cyclic meaning where extremes reconnect.<br>• emotion cycles: fear → courage → overconfidence → fear.<br>• formality loops: casual → formal → ceremonial → casual.<br>• epistemic cycles: guess → belief → certainty → doubt → guess. |
| 🕳️ Negative curvature (hyperbolic / $H^n$) | Space that expands faster than you expect; triangles don't add to 180°. | $K<0$ manifolds with exponential metric growth. Good for hierarchical trees and branching. | Semantic saddle: directions diverge sharply. | May be suitable for hierarchical and branching meaning.<br>• discourse relations: evidence → reason → conclusion (branching).<br>• taxonomy: dog → mammal → animal → organism.<br>• social stance divergence: neutral → [friendly OR hostile]. |
| 🪢 Projective space $\mathbb{RP}^n$ | Opposite points become "the same direction". Orientation is lost. | Quotient of sphere by antipodal ID. Captures directions up to sign: $v\sim -v$. | A semantic compass with no "forward/backward", only direction. | Potentially applicable when meanings differ only by direction but not polarity.<br>• verbs with causative/anticausative symmetry: break (transitive) vs break (intransitive).<br>• symmetry in motion terms: push/pull as same axis.<br>• gender-neutral pairs: actor/actress collapsing into "performer". |
| 🔄 Hyperbolic rotations / boosts (Lorentzian geometry) | Like mixing space and time — one dimension behaves differently. | Minkowski metric with signature $(-,+,+)$. Boosts mix axes asymmetrically. | A semantic tilt: certainty (time-like) mixes with evidence (space-like). | Could model asymmetric meaning changes.<br>• "I saw" → "I heard" → "I was told" (loss of immediacy).<br>• Intention → obligation → necessity (strengthening modality).<br>• "possible" → "likely" → "certain" (asymmetric, not cyclic). |
| 🎢 Curved manifolds with no symmetry | A world that bends differently in different directions everywhere. | Arbitrary Riemannian manifold: metric varies with position; curvature tensor ≠ constant. | Semantic theme park: every region has different slopes. | May be suitable for context-dependent meaning where geometry changes with the concept.<br>• polysemy: "charge" (money, electricity, accusation).<br>• pragmatic shifts: "fine" (OK / penalty).<br>• sarcasm: meaning bends depending on tone and stance. |
  
  
## 5️⃣ Tensor fields & fibre bundles  
  
***When meanings stop being points or rotations and instead become fields, connections, and parallel transport across conceptual space.***  
  
This is where linguistics starts behaving like GR: meanings deform each other, interact, and acquire context as you "move through" the manifold.

| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧵 Tensors $T^k_{\;\;l}$ | Things that take in directions and spit out new shapes. More complicated than vectors. | Multilinear maps on vectors/covectors; transform under coordinate changes; encode curvature, shear, correlation. | A deformation machine: push meaning → it stretches/rotates it. | May suit relations between semantic dimensions.<br>• "intensity & valence" interaction → angry vs frustrated.<br>• "politeness × power" → rude-upward vs rude-downward.<br>• "time × causation" → gradual vs sudden change. |
| 🛤️ Connections / covariant derivatives $\nabla$ | Rules for how meanings change smoothly as you "move". | A connection defines parallel transport, curvature, torsion across manifold. | A rail system for meaning: move along one concept, orientation shifts. | Could model context drift.<br>• modality drift: maybe → probably → definitely.<br>• perspective drift: I → you → they (stance).<br>• narrative tense progression: present → imperfect → conditional. |
| 🌄 Curvature tensors $R_{ijkl}$ | Measures how much the "space" bends when you go around a loop. | Encodes holonomy; failure of parallel transport to return vectors to themselves. | A semantic loop: return to the start and meaning has changed. | Potentially suitable for meaning that shifts in cycles.<br>• politeness loops in social hierarchy ("sir" used sarcastically).<br>• irony loops: literal → sarcastic → meta → literal-ish.<br>• identity terms under self/other framing. |
| 🪂 Fibre bundles $E \to M$ | A base world where each point carries its own little attached space. | Total space with fibres; sections assign an element in each fibre; gauge transformations act on fibres. | A Pokémon card deck at each location: same slots, different cards depending on context. | May be appropriate for concepts with local internal structure.<br>• pronouns: each discourse point has its own "I/you/he" fibres.<br>• politeness systems: each culture point has its own register choices.<br>• evidentiality systems (Turkish/Quechua): grammar changes with "source of knowledge". |
| 🔧 Gauge fields $A_\mu$ | Rules for how internal meaning changes as you move around. | Connections on fibre bundles; local symmetry groups act freely; holonomy creates meaning shifts. | A dial that rotates internally depending on path. | Could be useful for stance, belief, or identity drift.<br>• "believe → doubt → believe" cycles.<br>• Political stance drift on reading different sources.<br>• Formality drifting depending on conversational footing. |
  
  
## 6️⃣ Category-theoretic & algebraic geometries   
When meaning is not just in points or spaces, but in the arrows, transformations, and glue between them.

| 🏗️ Categories $\mathcal{C}$ (objects + arrows) | A world of "things" and "allowed transformations" between them. Focus is on how you can move, not what things "are". | A category has objects, morphisms, identity maps, and associative composition. Examples: Set, Vect, Poset, Top. | A transport network: stations (objects) + routes (arrows). | Could be useful for modelling types of expressions and allowable semantic moves.<br><br>• Objects = meaning types (proposition, question, command).<br>• Arrows = possible speech-act transforms (assert → question, statement → negation).<br>• Compositional grammar: NP + VP → S as morphisms between syntactic/semantic types. |
| 📦 Functors $F: \mathcal{C} \to \mathcal{D}$ | A translation system between two worlds that preserves structure. | Structure-preserving maps between categories: objects ↦ objects, arrows ↦ arrows, preserving composition and identities. | A dictionary of worlds: same pattern, different realisation. | May be useful for mapping form ↔ meaning.<br><br>• Syntax category → semantics category (Montague-style).<br>• Surface forms → logical forms (questions, modality, tense).<br>• Cross-lingual mapping: English category → French category, preserving relations like subject, tense, polarity. |
| 🧶 Natural transformations $\eta: F \Rightarrow G$ | A smooth way of turning one translation system into another, consistently everywhere. | Component-wise family of morphisms $\eta_X: F(X) \to G(X)$ natural in $X$; make diagrams commute. | Two translation apps with a consistent patch between them. | Could model systematic semantic drift or re-interpretation.<br><br>• Literal translation functor vs pragmatic translation functor, and a natural transformation modelling "polite softening".<br>• Factual semantics vs belief-state semantics (same structure, different interpretation).<br>• Legal vs everyday meaning of words ("cause", "responsibility"). |
| 🧱 Monoidal categories (⊗, I) | A setting where you can meaningfully talk about "putting things side by side" and combining them. | Categories with a tensor product ⊗ and unit object I, modelling composition (parallel or sequential). Used in quantum semantics, compositional distributional semantics. | A Lego system for meanings: you can snap pieces together in structured ways. | May be suitable for compositional phrase meaning.<br><br>• Adjective ⊗ noun: "happy ⊗ dog" → happy dog.<br>• Verb ⊗ arguments: "give ⊗ (agent, theme, goal)".<br>• Multi-modal semantics: text ⊗ gesture ⊗ prosody. |
| 🧩 Sheaves / presheaves | Ways of assigning local data to each "region" and then gluing it into something global. | Presheaf: contravariant functor from open sets (or contexts) to sets/spaces. Sheaf: presheaf with a consistent gluing condition. | A jigsaw of local meanings forming a global picture when they agree on overlaps. | Could be applicable to contextual and discourse semantics.<br><br>• Local meaning of a word in each discourse segment; global reading when they agree.<br>• Pronoun resolution: each clause gives local candidates, sheaf glues into a consistent referent.<br>• Sarcasm/metaphor: local literal reading vs global pragmatic reading. |
| 🌐 Topoi / logical universes | Entire self-contained "worlds of logic" where different rules can hold. | A topos is a category behaving like Set: has exponentials, subobject classifier, etc. Supports internal higher-order logic. | A self-consistent universe of meaning with its own logic. | May be useful for modelling different reasoning regimes.<br><br>• Default vs deontic vs probabilistic logic as different topoi.<br>• Legal vs moral vs conversational inference spaces.<br>• Belief-worlds: each agent's internal topos with its own entailments. |
