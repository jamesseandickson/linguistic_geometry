# 🗺️ Semantic Geometry Atlas  
  
This file contains a description of various geometries, and lists strong candidate concepts that could feasibly be well encoded at much lower entropy states by non-nensor geometries, the current LLM gold-standard.
  
## 1️⃣ Basic Euclidean geometries  
  
*Meaning as points, arrows, and simple directions — the calm, flat landscape of linguistic space.*

| 🔹 Scalars((\\mathbb{R})) | Single number. No direction, just “how much”. | Elements of a field (typically (\\mathbb{R}) or (\\mathbb{C})). Invariant under rotation; represent magnitude or intensity without orientation. | A thermometer: 12°C, no arrow—only size. | Good for 1-dimensional semantic intensity. • sentiment intensity: “good → excellent”, “bad → terrible” (valence magnitude). • certainty: “maybe → definitely” (confidence scalar). • formality: “informal → formal” (if context fixed). |
| 🧭 Vectors (v \\in \\mathbb{R}^n) | An arrow: magnitude + direction. A point in multi-dimensional semantic space. | Elements of a vector space (V). Transform under (GL(n)). Inner product gives lengths, angles, and similarity. | A location + direction in meaning space: “where is this word?”. | Good for multi-dimensional static meanings. • embeddings of “happy”, “sad”, “angry”. • “polite” vs “rude” in a politeness–stance–formality subspace. • “doctor”, “lawyer”, “teacher” in a profession manifold. |
  
  
## 2️⃣ Linear maps & rotations  
  
*Where meaning begins to move, transform, and show structure.*

| 🔄 Linear transforms (A : \\mathbb{R}^n \\to \\mathbb{R}^n) | A machine that stretches, shrinks, flips, or rotates vectors in a straight, predictable way. | Any map representable as matrix multiplication. Preserves vector addition and scalar multiplication. Fundamental for modelling semantic operations as linear operators. | A meaning dial: turn the knob and the meaning moves predictably. | Good for consistent, regular semantic shifts. • tense: “walk → walked” (simple linear morpho-shift). • comparative: “big → bigger”. • negation prefix: “happy → unhappy”. |
| 🔁 Rotations(R \\in SO(n)) | A rigid turning of space—changing direction, not size. | Orthogonal matrices with (\\det R = +1). Preserve norms and inner products. Symmetry group of Euclidean space. | A semantic compass, rotating meanings around a conceptual origin. | Good for opposites or axes. • “north ↔ south”, “up ↔ down” (spatial axes). • “before ↔ after” (temporal axis). • “increase ↔ decrease” (causal axis). |
  
  
## 3️⃣ Spinors & SU(2)  
  
*Where meaning “twists”, not just moves — hidden structure, double covers, and semantic rotations with memory.*

| 🌀 Spinors(elements of (\\mathbb{C}^2) or (\\mathbb{C}^n) with 720° identity) | A special kind of “rotation vector” that needs two full turns (720°) to get back to itself. Carries orientation in a richer way. | Representations of the group Spin(3) ≅ SU(2). Encode orientation with phase information. Transform under the double cover of rotations: (R \\in SO(3)) ↦ (U \\in SU(2)). | A semantic Möbius strip: twist meaning halfway, it flips; twist again, it returns. | Great for binary flips, opposites, symmetrical conceptual pairs. • polarity: polite ↔ rude, happy ↔ sad, kind ↔ cruel. • spatial axes: left ↔ right, in ↔ out. • negation: legal ↔ illegal(prefix or lexical). |
| ⚛️ SU(2) rotations(unitary 2×2 matrices with det=1) | The mathematical machinery that rotates spinors smoothly. | Continuous Lie group capturing all 3D rotations via unitary transformations. A richer, phase-carrying rotational algebra. | A 3-axis joystick for meaning, rotating concepts smoothly in ways vectors cannot. | Useful for multi-axis conceptual flips when there are two or three interacting oppositions. • social stance: supportive ↔ hostile (warm/cold + open/closed). • formality: casual → formal (but with politeness and authority axes intertwined). • evidentiality: visible → inferred → reported → assumed (cyclical epistemic phases). |
| 🧬 Spin-n representations | Like spin-½ but more elaborate (spin-1, spin-3/2…). | Higher irreps of SU(2), dimension (2j+1). Encode more complex phase/orientation states. | A multi-petalled semantic flower: more lobes = more nuanced orientations. | When a concept has multi-phase or cyclic states. • temporal aspect: start → ongoing → finish (spin-1 is a neat fit). • emotion cycles: calm → anxious → panicked → calm (quasi-cyclic). • power dynamics: submissive → equal → dominant (3-state). |
  
  
## 4️⃣ Non-Euclidean geometries  
  
***When meaning lives on curved worlds — distances bend, parallels misbehave, and concepts travel along warped paths.***  
  
These geometries matter when linguistic structure **is not linear**, **not symmetric**, or **not globally consistent** — where “going from A → B” depends on where you start, and concepts curve around each other.

| 🏔️ Positive curvature(spherical / (S^n)) | Like living on a globe: travel straight and you eventually return. Opposites meet. | Riemannian manifold with (K>0). Geodesics converge. Global symmetry but no global linearity. | A semantic Earth: “north” eventually meets “south” if you keep going. | Good for cyclic meaning where extremes reconnect. • emotion cycles: fear → courage → overconfidence → fear. • formality loops: casual → formal → ceremonial → casual. • epistemic cycles: guess → belief → certainty → doubt → guess. |
| 🕳️ Negative curvature(hyperbolic / (H^n)) | Space that expands faster than you expect; triangles don’t add to 180°. | (K<0) manifolds with exponential metric growth. Good for hierarchical trees and branching. | Semantic saddle: directions diverge sharply. | Ideal for hierarchical and branchingmeaning. • discourse relations: evidence → reason → conclusion (branching). • taxonomy: dog → mammal → animal → organism. • social stance divergence: neutral → [friendly OR hostile]. |
| 🪢 Projective space((\\mathbb{RP}^n)) | Opposite points become “the same direction”. Orientation is lost. | Quotient of sphere by antipodal ID. Captures directions up to sign: (v\\sim -v). | A semantic compasswith no “forward/backward”, only direction. | When meanings differ only by direction but not polarity. • verbs with causative/anticausative symmetry: break (transitive) vs break (intransitive). • symmetry in motion terms: push/pull as same axis. • gender-neutral pairs: actor/actress collapsing into “performer”. |
| 🔄 Hyperbolic rotations / boosts(Lorentzian geometry) | Like mixing space and time — one dimension behaves differently. | Minkowski metric with signature ((-,+,+)). Boosts mix axes asymmetrically. | A semantic tilt: certainty (time-like) mixes with evidence (space-like). | Good for asymmetric meaning changes. • “I saw” → “I heard” → “I was told” (loss of immediacy). • Intention → obligation → necessity (strengthening modality). • “possible” → “likely” → “certain” (asymmetric, not cyclic). |
| 🎢 Curved manifolds with no symmetry | A world that bends differently in different directions everywhere. | Arbitrary Riemannian manifold: metric varies with position; curvature tensor ≠ constant. | Semantic theme park: every region has different slopes. | Best for context-dependent meaning where geometry changes with the concept. • polysemy: “charge” (money, electricity, accusation). • pragmatic shifts: “fine” (OK / penalty). • sarcasm: meaning bends depending on tone and stance. |
  
  
## 5️⃣ Tensor fields & fibre bundles  
  
***When meanings stop being points or rotations and instead become fields, connections, and parallel transport across conceptual space.***  
  
This is where linguistics starts behaving like GR: meanings deform each other, interact, and acquire context as you “move through” the manifold.

| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 🧵 Tensors((T^k_{;;l})) | Things that take in directions and spit out new shapes. More complicated than vectors. | Multilinear maps on vectors/covectors; transform under coordinate changes; encode curvature, shear, correlation. | A deformation machine: push meaning → it stretches/rotates it. | Good for relations between semantic dimensions. • “intensity & valence” interaction → angry vs frustrated. • “politeness × power” → rude-upward vs rude-downward. • “time × causation” → gradual vs sudden change. |
| 🛤️ Connections / covariant derivatives((\\nabla)) | Rules for how meanings change smoothly as you “move”. | A connection defines parallel transport, curvature, torsion across manifold. | A rail systemfor meaning: move along one concept, orientation shifts. | Good for context drift. • modality drift: maybe → probably → definitely. • perspective drift: I → you → they (stance). • narrative tense progression: present → imperfect → conditional. |
| 🌄 Curvature tensors((R_{ijkl})) | Measures how much the “space” bends when you go around a loop. | Encodes holonomy; failure of parallel transport to return vectors to themselves. | A semantic loop: return to the start and meaning has changed. | Ideal for meaning that shifts in cycles. • politeness loops in social hierarchy (“sir” used sarcastically). • irony loops: literal → sarcastic → meta → literal-ish. • identity terms under self/other framing. |
| 🪂 Fibre bundles ((E \\to M)) | A base world where each point carries its own little attached space. | Total space with fibres; sections assign an element in each fibre; gauge transformations act on fibres. | A Pokémon card deck at each location: same slots, different cards depending on context. | Best for concepts with local internal structure. • pronouns: each discourse point has its own “I/you/he” fibres. • politeness systems: each culture point has its own register choices. • evidentiality systems (Turkish/Quechua): grammar changes with “source of knowledge”. |
| 🔧 Gauge fields((A_\\mu)) | Rules for how internal meaning changes as you move around. | Connections on fibre bundles; local symmetry groups act freely; holonomy creates meaning shifts. | A dial that rotates internally depending on path. | Great for stance, belief, or identity drift. • “believe → doubt → believe” cycles. • political stance drift on reading different sources. • formality drifting depending on conversational footing. |
  
  
## 6️⃣ Category-theoretic & algebraic geometries   
When meaning is not just in points or spaces, but in the arrows, transformations, and glue between them.

| 🏗️ Categories(\\mathcal{C}) (objects + arrows) | A world of “things” and “allowed transformations” between them. Focus is on howyou can move, not what things “are”. | A category has objects, morphisms, identity maps, and associative composition. Examples: Set, Vect, Poset, Top. | A transport network: stations (objects) + routes (arrows). | Good for modelling types of expressions and allowable semantic moves. • objects = meaning types (proposition, question, command). • arrows = possible speech-act transforms (assert → question, statement → negation). • compositional grammar: NP + VP → S as morphisms between syntactic/semantic types. |
| 📦 Functors (F: \\mathcal{C} \\to \\mathcal{D}) | A translation system between two worlds that preserves structure. | Structure-preserving maps between categories: objects ↦ objects, arrows ↦ arrows, preserving composition and identities. | A dictionary of worlds: same pattern, different realisation. | Useful for mapping form ↔ meaning. • syntax category → semantics category (Montague-style). • surface forms → logical forms (questions, modality, tense). • cross-lingual mapping: English category → French category, preserving relations like subject, tense, polarity. |
| 🧶 Natural transformations(\\eta: F \\Rightarrow G) | A smooth way of turning one translation system into another, consistently everywhere. | Component-wise family of morphisms (\\eta_X: F(X) \\to G(X)) natural in (X); make diagrams commute. | Two translation apps with a consistent patch between them. | Good for systematic semantic drift or re-interpretation. • literal translation functor vs pragmatic translation functor, and a natural transformation modelling “polite softening”. • factual semantics vs belief-state semantics (same structure, different interpretation). • legal vs everyday meaning of words (“cause”, “responsibility”). |
| 🧱 Monoidal categories (⊗, I) | A setting where you can meaningfully talk about “putting things side by side” and combining them. | Categories with a tensor product ⊗ and unit object I, modelling composition (parallel or sequential). Used in quantum semantics, compositional distributional semantics. | A Lego system for meanings: you can snap pieces together in structured ways. | Ideal for compositional phrase meaning. • adjective ⊗ noun: “happy ⊗ dog” → happy dog. • verb ⊗ arguments: “give ⊗ (agent, theme, goal)”. • multi-modal semantics: text ⊗ gesture ⊗ prosody. |
| 🧩 Sheaves / presheaves | Ways of assigning local data to each “region” and then gluing it into something global. | Presheaf: contravariant functor from open sets (or contexts) to sets/spaces. Sheaf: presheaf with a consistent gluing condition. | A jigsaw of local meaningsforming a global picture when they agree on overlaps. | Perfect for contextual and discourse semantics. • local meaning of a word in each discourse segment; global reading when they agree. • pronoun resolution: each clause gives local candidates, sheaf glues into a consistent referent. • sarcasm/metaphor: local literal reading vs global pragmatic reading. |
| 🌐 Topoi / logical universes | Entire self-contained “worlds of logic” where different rules can hold. | A topos is a category behaving like Set: has exponentials, subobject classifier, etc. Supports internal higher-order logic. | A self-consistent universe of meaningwith its own logic. | For modelling different reasoning regimes. • default vs deontic vs probabilistic logic as different topoi. • legal vs moral vs conversational inference spaces. • belief-worlds: each agent’s internal topos with its own entailments. |
